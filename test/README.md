# Autoglue testing

Right now this directory only contains a simple program used to test Autoglue features. While in the sandbox directory, execute the following:
```
python3 generate_autoglue.py
```

The output can be located in `sandbox/output`.

## TODO:
- This directory could also contain actual tests.
